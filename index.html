												<h4>Mind the Knowledge Gap: A Survey of Knowledge-enhanced Dialogue Systems</h4>
												<p>Many dialogue systems (DSs) lack characteristics humans have, such as emotion perception, factuality, and informativeness. Enhancing DSs with knowledge alleviates this problem, but, as many ways of doing so exist, keeping track of all proposed methods is difficult. Here, we present the first survey of knowledge-enhanced DSs. We define three categories of systems – internal, external, and hybrid – based on the knowledge they use. We survey the motivation for enhancing DSs with knowledge, used datasets, and methods for knowledge search, knowledge encoding, and knowledge incorporation. Finally, we propose how to improve existing systems based on theories from linguistics and cognitive science.</p>

												<h4>Emerging Challenges in Personalized Medicine: Assessing Demographic
													Effects on Biomedical Question Answering Systems</h4>
												<p>State-of-the-art question answering (QA) models exhibit a variety of social biases (e.g., with respect to sex or race), generally explained by similar issues in their training data. However, what has been overlooked so far is that in the critical domain of biomedicine, any unjustified change in model output due to patient demographics is problematic: it results in the unfair treatment of patients. Selecting only questions on biomedical topics whose answers do not depend on ethnicity, sex, or sexual orientation, we ask the following research questions: (RQ1) Do the answers of QA models change when being provided with irrelevant demographic information? (RQ2) Does the answer of RQ1 differ between knowl- edge graph (KG)-grounded and text-based QA systems? We find that irrelevant demographic information change up to 15% of the answers of a KG-grounded system and up to 23% of the answers of a text-based system, including changes that affect accuracy. We conclude that unjustified answer changes caused by patient demographics are a frequent phenomenon, which raises fairness concerns and should be paid more attention to.</p>

												<h4>Who Are All The Stochastic Parrots Imitating? They Should Tell Us!</h4>
												<p>Both standalone language models (LMs) as well as LMs within downstream-task systems have been shown to generate statements which are factually untrue. This problem is especially severe for low-resource languages, where train- ing data is scarce and of worse quality than for high-resource languages. In this opinion piece, we argue that LMs in their current state will never be fully trustworthy in critical settings and suggest a possible novel strategy to handle this issue: by building LMs such that can cite their sources – i.e., point a user to the parts of their training data that back up their out- puts. We first discuss which current NLP tasks would or would not benefit from such models. We then highlight the expected benefits such models would bring, e.g., quick verifiability of statements. We end by outlining the individ- ual tasks that would need to be solved on the way to developing LMs with the ability to cite. We hope to start a discussion about the field’s current approach to building LMs, especially for low-resource languages, and the role of the training data in explaining model generations.</p>

												<h4>Desiderata For The Context Use Of Question Answering Systems</h4>
												<p>Prior work has uncovered a set of common problems in state-of-the-art context-based question answering (QA) systems: a lack of attention to the context when the latter conflicts with a model's parametric knowledge, little robustness to noise, and a lack of consistency with their answers. However, most prior work focus on one or two of those problems in isolation, which makes it difficult to see trends across them. We aim to close this gap, by first outlining a set of -- previously discussed as well as novel -- desiderata for QA models. We then survey relevant analysis and methods papers to provide an overview of the state of the field. The second part of our work presents  experiments where we evaluate 11 QA systems on 4 datasets according to all desiderata at once. We find many novel trends, including (1) systems that are less susceptible to noise are not necessarily more consistent with their answers when given irrelevant context; (2) most systems that are more susceptible to noise are more likely to correctly answer according to a context that conflicts with their parametric knowledge; and (3) the combination of conflicting knowledge and noise can reduce system performance by up to 96$. As such, our desiderata help increase our understanding of how these models work and reveal potential avenues for improvements.</p>

												<h4>Comparing Template-based and Template-free Language Model Probing</h4>
												<p>The differences between cloze-task language model (LM) probing with 1)  expert-made templates and 2) naturally-occurring text have often been overlooked. Here, we evaluate 16 different LMs on 10 probing datasets -- 4 template-based and 6 template-free -- in multiple domains to answer the following research questions: (RQ1) Do model rankings differ between the two approaches? (RQ2) Do models' absolute scores differ between the two approaches? (RQ3) Do the answers to RQ1 and RQ2 differ between general and domain-specific models? Our findings are: 1) Template-free and template-based approaches often rank models differently, except for the top domain-specific models. 2) Scores decrease by up to 42$ Acc@1 when comparing parallel template-free and template-based prompts. 3) Perplexity is negatively correlated with accuracy in the template-free approach, but, counter-intuitively, they are positively correlated for template-based probing. 4) Models tend to predict the same answers frequently across prompts for template-based probing, which is less common when employing template-free techniques.</p>

												<h4>Disease Informed Neural Networks</h4>
												<p>We introduce Disease Informed Neural Networks (DINNs) — neural networks capable of learning how diseases spread, forecasting their progression, and finding their unique parameters (e.g. death rate). Here, we used DINNs to identify the dynamics of 11 highly infectious and deadly diseases. These systems vary in their complexity, ranging from 3D to 9D ODEs, and from a few parameters to over a dozen. The diseases include COVID, Anthrax, HIV, Zika, Smallpox, Tuberculosis, Pneumonia, Ebola, Dengue, Polio, and Measles.</p>
