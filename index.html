												<h4>Mind the Knowledge Gap: A Survey of Knowledge-enhanced Dialogue Systems</h4>
												<p>Many dialogue systems (DSs) lack characteristics humans have, such as emotion perception, factuality, and informativeness. Enhancing DSs with knowledge alleviates this problem, but, as many ways of doing so exist, keeping track of all proposed methods is difficult. Here, we present the first survey of knowledge-enhanced DSs. We define three categories of systems – internal, external, and hybrid – based on the knowledge they use. We survey the motivation for enhancing DSs with knowledge, used datasets, and methods for knowledge search, knowledge encoding, and knowledge incorporation. Finally, we propose how to improve existing systems based on theories from linguistics and cognitive science.</p>

												<h4>Transformer-based Biomedical Question Answering Systems Exhibit Social Biases</h4>
												<p>State-of-the-art machine learning  approaches to question answering (QA) exhibit a variety of social biases (e.g., with respect to sex or race), generally explained by similar issues in their training data. However, it is unclear if such problems also affect models for the biomedical domain, which are trained on biomedical texts, which are widely believed to be unbiased. Selecting only questions on scientific and clinical topics whose answers do not depend on ethnicity, sex, or sexual orientation, we ask the following research questions: (RQ1) Do the models' answers change when being provided with (irrelevant) demographic information? (RQ2) Does the answer of RQ1 differ between KG-grounded and text-based QA systems? We find that irrelevant demographic information changes up to 15% of the answers of a KG-grounded system and up to 23% of the answers of a text-based system, including changes that affect accuracy. These results provide evidence that bias in biomedical QA systems is a pressing problem.</p>

												<h4>On Language Models Medicine and Factuality</h4>
												<p>We introduce an algorithm for evaluating the factuality of biomedical language models. In contrast to previously proposed template-based strategies, we use naturally occurring text while still not requiring expert involvement. Our results highlight shortcomings of templates when evaluating factuality, as we find much larger differences between models that are trained from scratch and models that are finetuned on medical text. In addition and in contrast to previous evaluation methods, our approach indicates that all biomedical models outperform all vanilla models. Finally, we also find that pseudo-perplexity is not correlated with factuality and that more training data does not necessarily result in more factual output.

												<h4>Disease Informed Neural Networks</h4>
												<p>We introduce Disease Informed Neural Networks (DINNs) — neural networks capable of learning how diseases spread, forecasting their progression, and finding their unique parameters (e.g. death rate). Here, we used DINNs to identify the dynamics of 11 highly infectious and deadly diseases. These systems vary in their complexity, ranging from 3D to 9D ODEs, and from a few parameters to over a dozen. The diseases include COVID, Anthrax, HIV, Zika, Smallpox, Tuberculosis, Pneumonia, Ebola, Dengue, Polio, and Measles.</p>
